Processing Development Environment files

This container will be reserved for all .pde files. 
All .pde files here are coded in Processing IDE ( visit https://processing.org/ )
Processing is a language that is commonly used for developing mini games, graphics interpolation/manipulation, UI/UX templates, motion simulations and many more.  

1. platformgame.pde is a source code for a Platform Game project that is of personal interest to investigate the momentum and parabolic motion of an object jumping off platforms. 
    - the code is built on parabolic motion equations and has a component to enable double-jumping. 
    - level0.png is a .png file that is fed into the source code for the experimental platform stage and the use for debugging.
    - this project is still pending completion, and is hoped to be added in with a few features that can be developed into a realistic platform game.
